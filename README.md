Air pollution has become a significant environmental issue, posing serious health risks to millions of people worldwide. 
"IOT Based Air Pollution Monitoring System using Raspberry Pi" is created to design and implement a cost-effective, real-time system for monitoring air quality by detecting harmful gases and pollutants in the environment.
 The system leverages IoT technology to continuously collect air pollution data using sensors, processes the data on a Raspberry Pi, and transmits it to a cloud platform for visualization and analysis i.e. ThingsBoard. 
This project aims to provide an accessible solution to help monitor and manage air quality, enabling timely actions to mitigate pollution and safeguard public health.

ThingsBoard Integration:
1. Real-time data monitoring: AQI, sensor voltage, and PPM values are visualized.
2. ThingsBoard Cloud: Data sent via HTTP API to the ThingsBoard cloud server.
3. Visualization Widgets: Real-time graphs, gauges, and widgets.
4. Data History: Storing and visualizing historical air quality data.

The Air Quality Index (AQI) monitoring project, integrating the MQ-135 sensor and ThingsBoard platform, holds significant potential for future expansion. 
By incorporating advanced data analytics, multi-sensor integration, cloud-based monitoring, mobile applications, and IoT enhancements, the project can evolve into a comprehensive air quality management system. 
These advancements would not only offer real-time monitoring and improved accuracy but also provide valuable insights for public health, smart cities, and environmental sustainability
